# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic


### Introduction:

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used for this project is derived from the famous Titanic disaster, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not based on various features such as age, class, fare, and more. This project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook (Titanic_ML1(task).ipynb) for data analysis and model building, and the dataset is provided in a CSV file (train.csv).

## Dataset:

The dataset (train.csv) includes the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Project Structure:

Titanic_ML1(task).ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the entire workflow of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
train.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training the machine learning models.

## Model Building:

The notebook includes the following steps:

# 1-Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset through various visualizations and statistical analysis.
# 2-Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
# 3-Model Training: Training  machine learning models:
# Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification problems.

# 4-Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy

## Results:
The results of the model evaluations are documented in the notebook, where the best-performing model is selected based on its accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
